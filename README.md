# EdinburghRamadanTimetable2017

- This is now available on the Play Store to download.

- My first app to be available on the Play Store. 

- Designed specifically for the upcoming month of Ramadan, it uses SQLLite and Android Studio elements to give the user the data 
they need and when they need it.

- Will add more features and a better designed UI when I get the opportunity.

- Uses data provided by my local mosque for the date and times.

- Only made for Edinburgh locals but app is available worldwide.
